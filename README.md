TASK---3
Step 1 : Import libraries ,
         pandas -  for data manipulation and analysis.
         numpy -  for numerical computing.
         matplotlib.pyplot - for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
         seaborn - for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.
         train_test_split - this function is used to split a dataset into training and testing sets. 
         LinearRegression - this class implements linear regression, a statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. 
         mean_absolute_error - this function calculates the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
         mean_squared_error - this function calculates the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
         r2_score - this function calculates the R-squared value, also known as the coefficient of determination.
Step 2 : Load your dataset.
Step 3 : Preview the data.
Step 4 : Assume target is 'price' and drop non-numeric or unnecessary columns.
Step 4 : convert categorical columns to numeric.
Step 5 : Split the data into training and testing sets.
Step 6 : Fit Linear Regression model.
Step 7 : Evaluate the model.
Step 8 : Plot Regression Line for a single feature and intrepret coefficients.
